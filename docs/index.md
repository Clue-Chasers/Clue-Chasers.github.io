Clue Chasers is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6djqFVN) with the largest collection of RS3 Clue related content.

<script src="javascripts/discordInvite.js"></script>
<script>
discordInvite.init({
  inviteCode: 'cluechasers',
  title: 'PVME',
  });
  discordInvite.render();
</script>
<div id="discordInviteBox"></div>

- This website has all the same information and is updated daily.
- It's a copy of [PvME](https://pvme.github.io) edited to fit Clue Chasers.

## Motivation

- Make the Clue Chasers content available outside of Discord.
- Improve navigation through a powerful search and an always-visible table of contents.
- Fast and lightweight thanks to [Mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
