# How The Site Works

Full process on [Github](https://github.com/Clue-Chasers/Clue-Chasers.github.io), and in short:

1. Gather the `.txt` files from the [clue chasers master repository](https://github.com/Clue-Chasers/Clue-Chasers.github.io).
2. Format `.txt` -> `.md`.
3. Build the website from the `.md` files using [MKDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

## Limitations

First and foremost, the information on the website are always up-to-date with the Clue Chasers Discord Server.

This is because both are using the `.txt` guides from the [clue chasers master repository](https://github.com/Clue-Chasers/Clue-Chasers.github.io).

I try to stay ahead of this by adding formatting rules that exclude or change Discord-only content.

If you find any formatting issues, please message either (Pleb#0025) / (Saltea#5509) on Discord or create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Clue-Chasers/Clue-Chasers.github.io).
